\section{Air Quality in Scotland}
In the last few years, air quality is becoming increasingly important in everyone's daily life as people and government institutions are becoming more aware of the hazards of air pollution. In Scotland alone there are in total 32 "pollution zones" which are considered to break European safety standards. Also, as far as humans are concerned air pollution has a negative impact towards our health, diminishing our life quality and causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. It is also known that some population groups are more vulnerable than others, for example, children are more affected than adults because their lungs are still developing. Furthermore, people with respiratory diseases suffers from aggravated symptoms because their airways get irritated when an air pollution spike is triggered. 


The effects of air pollution on human health are still complex to understand and there is much research ongoing on the combination short and long term effects upon a person's health.
