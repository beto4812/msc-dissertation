\section{Aims and Objectives}
The first aim of this project is to revise current approaches to air quality data dissemination and visualisation. Furthermore, this project examines the current needs of pollution-sensitive and non-sensitive users towards a new air-quality data dissemination tool in order to accomplish the main goal: to develop and implement a mobile application to visualise air quality data in a useful and understandable way. 

Another important objective is to take on a more user-centred approach whilst achieving this main goal, by bearing in mind the users as co-designers and stakeholders throughout three different design iterations of the product for the creation of a final prototype that reflects more accurately the user needs and thoughts.
