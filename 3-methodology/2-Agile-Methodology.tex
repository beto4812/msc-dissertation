\section{Agile methodology}
Because a piece of software was developed, the development process followed an agile methodology as a good software engineering practice. The benefits of this approach over other ones is that more focus is paid to the product than to the management process, this proves to be a strong advantage when working on constantly-changing and time-constrained projects such as my dissertation project.
The agile manifesto \cite{Martin2002} establishes four values to guide a development process: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  \item Working software over comprehensive documentation
  \item Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  \item Responding to change over following a plan. 
\end{itemize}

More grounded, choosing this methodology as a software development approach means that there is no intention to deliver full documentation, manuals or specifications, but that the working software will be delivered with its different phases and prototypes, and that there is a plan up to some extent, including a calendar of deliverables, and management tools are used to guide the development.
