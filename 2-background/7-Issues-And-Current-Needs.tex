\section{Issues and current needs}
From outlining why pollution matters, its relevance to different population groups and the use of visualization to convey relevant data, the limitations of current approaches as a means of communication become apparent. Current approaches fail to take into account the general population and sensitive pollution users according to the COMEAP. There is the need for a tool that includes both user groups and their personal circumstances in order to provide more accurate information for the purpose of decision making. It was also outlined how apps are enabled to create new enhanced personal experiences being an appropriate vehicle to achieve such need.
