\section{Aims and Objectives}
The aim of my dissertation project is to analyze develop and implement a mobile application to visualize air pollution data in a useful way. The targeted users are the general public who are interested in software as a decision support tool to enable them taking informed decisions to diminish and avoid negative effects on their health.
Air quality data is becoming more accessble and available every day, new sensors are being developed but there is still lack of research on how it can be presented to the general public in an interactive and useful way.
